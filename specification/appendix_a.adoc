== Appendix A: THCS and VHCS

The TSM Hart Control Structure (THCS) is divided into two sections - the 
Hart Supervisor State Area (HSSA) and the TSM Supervisor State Area (TSSA). 
This structure is specified as part of the TEEI as the recommended minimum 
that the TSM-driver should support to isolate TSM state.

VMM-managed hart f/v registers* are expected to be saved/restored by the 
VMM before a TEECALL, and restored (similar to v/f register management 
performed by the VMM for ordinary guest VMs). The TSM-driver saves OS/VMM 
S/HS-mode CSRs and x registers on ECALLs into the HSSA on a TEECALL (per 
the RISC-V SBI <<R5>> convention). The TSM-driver initializesTSM S/HS-mode 
CSRs from the TSSA on entry into the TSM (via TEECALL). Per-Hart TSM f/v 
registers* state is managed (saved/restored) by the TSM in reserved memory 
for the TSM (hence not shown below).

*TVM per-hart state x/v/f is saved/restored by the TSM* (prior to SRET and 
post delegated-trap into the TSM from the TVM) and uses the dynamic memory 
assigned to the TEE VM. The control structure for the TVM virtual hart is 
shown as the VHCS below. These guest control CSRs are restored by the TSM 
when a TVM virtual hart is being entered and is configured on the required 
state of that TVM.

handled by the TSM (default all)

| hgatp       | TVM enforces page remap protection via this G-stage
translation. Hart register is programmed by TSM to activate at TVM entry 
via SRET
| The values htval and htinst are cleared by TSM on TEECALL and masked (to 
clear page offset) by the TSM on a TEERET when reporting a guest page

the TSM per virtual hart for TVMs._ |
