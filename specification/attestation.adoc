== TVM Attestation

=== TCB Elements

Elements considered to be in the TCB for AP-TEE workloads are summarized 
below:

Hardware/firmware 

* CPU: All hardware logic, including MMU, caches 
* SOC: All hardware subsystems including memory confidentiality, integrity 
and replay-protection for volatile memory
* RoT for TCB measurement, evidence reporting, attestation, sealing
* IOMMU
* (optional) Devices may be included in the TCB if the devices support 
reporting evidence of their security posture.

Software/firmware

* TSM-driver that hosts a TEEI (with TH-ABI and TG-ABI security routines). 
Note that since the TSM-driver operates in M-mode, all M-mode firmware is 
included in the TCB for AP-TEE workloads.
* TEE Security Manager (TSM) and user-mode TSM components
* For confidential application/VM workloads, an AP-TEE-compatible 
Runtime/guest OS may be included for portability (but is not required).

=== Attestation

The TCB described above is reported to relying parties via an attestation 
mechanism and protocol.

*Framework*

The IETF RATS [x] describes the following reference model for attestation. 
In Remote Attestation, the Attester produces information about itself 
(Evidence) to enable a remote peer (the Relying Party) to decide whether to 
consider that Attester a trustworthy peer or not. The Verifier appraises 
evidence via appraisal policies and creates the Attestation Results to 
support Relying Parties in their decision process.

Figure 4: Remote Attestation Framework (IETF RATS)

This TEE proposal uses the layered attestation model <<R1>> where the RoT 
is the initial Attesting Environment. Claims are collected from or about 
each layer.  The corresponding Claims can be structured in a nested fashion 
that reflects the nesting of the Attester's layers.  The previous layer 
acts as the Attesting Environment for the next layer.  Claims about a RoT 
typically are asserted by an Endorser.

The following are the key requirements for attestation mapped to this 
AP-TEE architecture:

In order for the TCB (described above) to be enforced by the architecture, 
the TSM driver measures the untrusted-host-supplied TSM binary and records 
its measurements, vendor and version into measurement registers which can 
be attested to via the HW RoT-rooted keys. 

The TSM must then provide an implementation of a TEE-Guest ABI (TG-ABI) 
operation (teecall_tg_get_evidence)  to enable a TVM to generate 
attestation evidence that a relying party can verify using the certificate 
chain. 

The TCB extension and evidence collection for a TVM attestation is shown 
below:

Figure 5: Layered Attestation architecture for TVMs

It is expected that an implementation will provide implementation-specific 
intrinsics to record measurements of the TSM into the firmware RoT for 
measurement to support the layered RTMs and attestation of AP-TEE workloads. 

*Attestation Evidence*

Suitable evidence formats may be used by the Attester to present the 
evidence that the TVM is executing as a TEE. The evidence should attest to 
the above layered trust chain. The TSM must allow for attestation operation 
(certifying TVM measurements) to be executed in an interruptible manner. 
Once such evidence format is specified in the TCG DICE Attestation 
Architecture which describes evidence as X.509 Certificate with an 
extension for *TCB Info Evidence <<R2>>. 

The following key fields are present in that DiceTcbInfo (See OID in spec 
[2]). The fields are listed here with the usage described specific to the 
AP-TEE reference architecture.

|=== 
| *Field*      | *Type*       |  *Description*
| Vendor       | UTF8String   | The entity that created the TCB component.
| Model        | UTF8String   | The product name associated with the TCB 
component.
| Version      | UTF8String   | The revision string associated with the TCB 
component.
| SVN          | Integer      | The security version number associated with 
the TCB component - the SVN makes parsing of the TCB simpler to 
differentiate updates that affect security from non-security related 
updates.
| Layer        | Integer      | The DICE layer associated with this 
measurement of the TCB component.
| Index        | Integer      | A value that enumerates measurement of 
assets within the TCB component and DICE layer.
| FWIDs        | List of FWID | A list of FWID values resulting from 
applying the hashAlg function over the object being measured (recommended 
components should cover: code, config, static data of a specific TCB binary 
component). FWIDs are computed by the DICE layer that is the Attesting 
Environment and certificate Issuer. Each FWID consists of:* HashAlg (OID) – 
an algorithm identifier for the hash algorithm used to produce a digest 
value.* Digest – a digest of the firmware, initialization values, or other 
settings of the TCB component.
| Flags        | Uint8        | Enumerates potentially simultaneous 
operational states of the TCB component: (i) notConfigured, (ii) notSecure, 
(iii) recovery, (iv) debug. A value of 1 (TRUE) means the operational mode 
is active. A value of 0 (FALSE) means the operational state is not active. 
If the flags field is omitted, all flags are assumed to be 0 
(FALSE).
| VendorInfo   | Octet String | Vendor supplied values that encode vendor, 
model, or device specific state
| Type         | Octet String | A machine readable description of the 
measurement

This extension defines attestation evidence about the DICE layer that is 
associated with the Subject key. The certificate Subject and 
SubjectPublicKey identify the entity to which the DiceTcbInfo extension 
applies. When this extension is used, the measurements in the evidence 
usually describe the software/firmware (and configuration) which will 
execute within the TCB. The AuthorityKeyIdentifier extension [2] MUST be 
supplied when the DiceTcbInfo extension is supplied. This allows the 
Verifier to locate the signer’s certificate. The DiceTcbInfo extension 
should be included with CRL entries that revoke the certificate that 
originally included the said DiceTcbInfo extension. 

For TVM attestation, the following TCB Evidence Info will be sequenced 
using the above DiceTcbInfo structure. Multiple evidences may be provided 
via the *MultiDiceTcbInfo* extension:

* Cryptographic hash of the RoT FW binary and configuration, along with its 
SVN and other fields; 
* Cryptographic hash of the TSM-driver binary and configuration, along with 
its SVN and other fields ; 
* Cryptographic hash of the TSM binary and configuration, with its SVN and 
other fields; 
* Cryptographic hash of the OSAM (described below) binary and 
configuration, with its SVN and other fields - this is applicable for 
remote attestation only;
  ** If OSAM is a 3rd party - the certifying entity will need a separate 
evidence entry. 
* Cryptographic hash of the TVM static binaries and configuration, along 
with its SVN and other fields.
* The TVM may additionally extend cryptographic measurements for other 
workload binaries and configuration loaded dynamically subsequent to boot 
via the TG-ABI.

The TVM TCB Evidence Info is managed by the TSM and is combined with the 
TSM’s TCB Evidence info that is in turn managed by the TSM-driver. The 
TSM-driver provides a TEEI security routine to enable the TSM and 
transitively the TVM to generate an Attestation CDI (Composite Device 
Identifier) and key to participate in an Attestation certificate-based 
protocol for remote (and local) attestation.

We recommend at least the following CDIs to be supported for AP-TEE 
workloads:

. Attestation CDI - This CDI is derived from the combination of the input 
values listed above and is expected to change across software updates or 
configuration changes of these components. This CDI is meant for remote 
attestation and is mandatory for AP-TEE implementations.
. Versioned Sealing CDI - This CDI is also derived from the combination of 
the input values listed above seeded with a component security version 
number. This Versioned Sealing CDI allows for the sealing key to be bound 
to a version chain of the TCB components. This CDI is appropriate for 
sealing and is recommended for AP-TEE implementations.

For remote attestation of a TVM, an X.509 Attestation certificate 
(structure shown below) is provisioned or generated on-demand for the TVM 
via the TSM. This process requires the generation of a CDI certificate 
where the subject key pair is derived from the Attestation CDI value for 
any layer (e.g. TSM-driver). The authority key pair which signs the 
certificate (e.g. RoT) is derived from the UDS (for the RoT) or, after the 
initial hardware to software transition, from the Attestation CDI value for 
the current layer (e.g. TSM-driver). The DICE flow outputs the CDI values 
and the generated certificate; the private key associated with the 
certificate may be optionally passed along with the CDI values to avoid the 
need for re-derivation by the target layer. The UDS-derived public key is 
certified by an external authority during manufacturing to root the 
certificate chain in a HW RoT. 

As a tangible example, the CDI private key for the TSM were used to sign a 
leaf certificate for an attestation key for the TVM, the certificate chain 
may look like this:

Figure 6: Attestation Certificate generation

This attestation certificate can be used in a challenge/response protocol 
to a remote relying party which must verify the certificate chain for the 
attestation key used to sign the relying party challenge. 

The Attestation key and certificate generation for TVMs may be performed 
with a U-mode TSM component called the Owner Signing Authority Module 
(OSAM) to enable a extension of the TCB to support interruptible signing 
operations. The OSAM may execute as part of the TSM or may be executed in 
the TSM U-mode to allow for the interruptibility models discussed in the 
TSM operation section of this document.

*TVM* *Attestation:*

X.509 CDI Certificates are used to enable Attestation certificates derived 
from the TSM CDI for each TVM hosted on the platform. All standard fields 
of a CDI certificate are described in the following table. This certificate 
can be generated given a CDI_Public key and the DICE input values.

The TSM can issue an Attestation certificate to the TVM which includes the 
TVM TcbInfo, and can transfer that certificate to the TVM during 
initialization via a guest firmware mechanism (e.g. device tree or UEFI HOB). 
Alternately, the TSM can provide an interface to sign TVM TcBInfo and 
additional data (such as DRTM measurements done by the TVM) at runtime via 
the teecall_tg_gen_cert interface to generate additional TVM Attestation 
certificates.

ECALL ( *teecall_tg_gen_cert* ): invoked by TVM - this TEEI operation is 
serviced by the TSM.
