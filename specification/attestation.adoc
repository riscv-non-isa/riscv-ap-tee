== TVM Attestation and Measurements

The CoVE TVM attestation framework allows for CoVE workload owners to assert
the trustworthiness of the hardware and software environment their workload is
running in.

Attestation relies on the ability for the SoC to generate a cryptographic evidence
for a workload executing in a CoVE TVM. The workload executing in a TVM may
request this cryptographic evidence to relay to a remote relying party which can
then verify that the evidence is valid (per some appraisal policy), and thus attest
to the trustworthiness of the TVM. The relying party can then accept to release
secrets or attestation result tokens back to the trusted workload.

This section describes the CoVE attestation evidence content, format and
generation interface.

=== Measurements

A CoVE workload measurement is a cryptographic hash of at least one of the
TCB elements for the workload. Measurements can only be extended with additional
data, by applying a cryptographic hash algorithm (`H~alg~`) to the current
measurement value (`M~current~`):

:stem: asciimath
[.center]
[stem]
++++
M_{extended} = H_{alg}(M_{current} || NewData)
++++

Measurements must be stored in integrity protected measurement registers,
either in the Hardware RoT of Measurement (RoTM) or in the TSM when it acts as
an extended RoTM.

In order to verify a workload environment trustworthiness, the remote
attestation service must be able to compare the CoVE TCB measurements with a
set of reference values. All components of what constitues the workload Trusted
Computing Base (TCB) must be measured and included in the attestation evidence.

==== TCB Elements

Elements considered to be in the TCB for CoVE workloads are both hardware
and software components.

The overall workload TCB is a composition of 3 independent TCBs:

1. The Platform TCB is made of all hardware and software TCB elements for
the CoVE host platform. They are not confidential compute specific and
measurements for those elements could be shared with e.g. a measured boot
attestation.
2. The TSM TCB elements are the confidential compute specific but TVM agnostic
elements for the overall TCB.
3. The TVM TCB is composed of the TVM specific elements.

The TCB elements for each of them is summarized in the following table:

.COVE Workload TCB Elements
[cols="^1, ^5v, ^4v", options="header"]
|===
|TCB |Hardware Elements |Software Elements

.4+.^|Platform
    <| HW RoT for boot, measurement and storage
 .4+<| All M-mode firmwares, including the TSM-driver
    <| All CPU hardware logic, including MMU and caches
    <| All SoC subsystems, including memory confidentiality, integrity and replay-protection for volatile memory
    <| IOMMU and translation agents

     | TEE Security Manager (TSM) and its U-mode components

     | TVM
     | Directly assigned, TEE-IO compliant devices
     | All TVM measured pages
|===

==== TVM Measurements

At a high level, a TVM measurement is separated into a set of static
measurements and a dynamic one.

===== Static Measurements

TVM static measurements are generated from the CoVE workload TCB elements
involved in the TVM construction. Any TCB element that directly or indirectly
supports a TVM must be measured into the TVM static measurement registers. Once
a TVM is finalized, i.e. after the `sbi_tee_host_finalize_tvm()` TH-ABI is
called, the TVM static measurements must no longer be extended.

Each TVM's static measurements are stored in dedicated measurement registers and
a CoVE implementation must provide at least 1 and at most 8 of them. The
static measurement registers cover platform, TSM & TVM specific TCB element
measurements.

Since they hold TCB elements measurements bound to the platform lifetime, the
platform/TSM measurement registers may be stored in the hardware Root of Trust
for Measurement (RTM). The TVM measurements must be maintained in TSM
confidential memory with TVM bound life cycle, effectively making the TSM an
extended RTM for the TVM.

The static TCB measurement mechanism and storage layout is implementation
specific. One such possible layout, based on a 6 static measurement registers
CoVE implementation may look like the following table:

.Static Measurements Layout Example (6 registers)

     | 5
     | TVM Configuration
    <| TVM Entry Point and Initial Arguments
     | TSM
|===

===== Dynamic Measurements

After the TVM is finalized, static measurements are immutable and can no longer
be modified. However, a TVM guest may want to measure some of its software
components (Guest firmware, kernel OS, additional configuration parameters, etc)
while it is booting or running.

The TSM optionally provides an interface for TVM guests to extend their
measurement into dynamic measurement registers. When supporting that feature,
the TSM must store dynamic measurements separately from the TVM static ones. The
TSM can use up to 8 dynamic measurement registers for that purpose.

The TVM measurement extension interface is exposed through the optional TG-ABI
`sbi_covg_extend_measurement()` FID.

=== Attestation

All above described TCB elements measurements are added to an attestation
evidence and then reported to relying parties. The attestation mechanism
and protocol that take place between the attester (i.e. the TVM) and the
remote attestation service are out of this document scope.

In this section we describe the high level attestation model for CoVE,
together with the attestation evidence content, format and generation process.

==== Model

The CoVE attestation model follows the IETF RATS <<R1>> Remote Attestation
architecture. CoVE implementations perform the RATS Attester role, and each CoVE
TCB component participates to the generation of a layered Attestation Evidence
composed of TCB specific Claims. Moreover, the generated CoVE Evidence freshness
is established through the inclusion on a cryptographic nonce in the TVM Claims
Set. This is enforced by the `sbi_covg_get_evidence` intrinsic signature.

In Remote Attestation, the Attester produces information about itself
(Evidence) to enable a remote peer (the Relying Party) to decide whether to
consider that Attester a trustworthy peer or not.
The Verifier authenticates the Evidence with Endorser provided trust anchors
(Endorsements), compares it against Reference Values and appraises it via
appraisal policies. It eventually creates Attestation Results to support
Relying Parties in their decision process.

==== Layered Evidence

The CoVE Attestation Evidence is a collection of Claims representing the
overall workload TCB and state, which includes those of the platform, TSM
and TVM. It uses the DICE<<DICE>> layered attestation model where each TCB layer
collects Claims about the layers it loads, acting as the Attesting Environment
for them. As the root TCB layer, the hardware RoT is the initial CoVE Attesting
Environment and its own Claims are asserted by an Endorser.

In the DICE model, each TCB layer computes the Compound Device Identifier (CDI)
for the layer it loads. CDIs are secrets that must not leave the CoVE TCB. The
root TCB layer, i.e. the hardware RoT, is factory provisioned with a Unique
Device Secret (UDS) that serves as the original secret from which all other CDIs
are directly or indirectly derived. As such, the TVM CDI is rooted into the
provisioned and platform manufacturer endorsed UDS.
The CDI for the current TCB layer is a cryptographic derivation of a combination
of the Attesting Environment CDI (i.e. the loading TCB layer) and the current
TCB layer measurements:

:stem: asciimath
[.center]
[stem]
++++
CDI_{0} = KDF(UDS_{Len},\ UDS\ ||\ H_{alg}(Meas(TCB_{0}))
++++
:stem: asciimath
[.center]
[stem]
++++
CDI_{N} = KDF(CDI_{Len},\ CDI_{N-1}\ ||\ H_{alg}(Meas(TCB_{N}))
++++

Asymmetric key pairs can be derived from a CDI in order to generate the
attestation key for a DICE layer. This key can then be used to attest of the
next TCB layer.

:stem: asciimath
[.center]
[stem]
++++
(UDS\_PrivKey,\ UDS\_PubKey) = AsymKDF(UDS)
++++
:stem: asciimath
[.center]
[stem]
++++
(CDI\_PrivKey_{N},\ CDI\_PubKey_{N}) = AsymKDF(CDI_{N})
++++

A fixed length TCB layer identifier called `CDI_ID` can be derived from its
attestation key:

:stem: asciimath
[.center]
[stem]
++++
UDS\_ID = KeyDerivationFunction(ID_{Len}, UDS\_PubKey)
++++
:stem: asciimath
[.center]
[stem]
++++
CDI\_ID_{N} = KeyDerivationFunction(ID_{Len}, CDI\_PubKey_{N})
++++

When loading the next TCB layer, the attesting layer provides it with both its
CDI and its attestation certificate.

As the first step in the CoVE DICE chain, the hardware RoT is responsible for:

1. Generating the Platform CDIs. This is the output of a KDF that takes the UDS
and a combination of an extended cryptographic hash of all the Platform TCB
software components.
2. Generating the Platform attestation certificate. This is a nested EAT which
Claims are described in <<Platform Token>>, and include all the Platform CDI
inputs. It is signed by the RoT attestation key, which is derived from the UDS
itself.
3. Passing both the Platform CDI and certificate to the TSM-driver

The next step in the DICE chain is the TSM-driver. It is responsible for
generating the TSM CDI and attestation certificate and follow similar steps as
the above described ones to do so. The generated TSM attestation certificate is
composed of both the hardware RoT generated Platform Token and the TSM-driver
created TSM Token (See <<TSM Token>>). It is signed by the Platform CDI-derived
attestation key.

As the following step in the DICE chain, the TSM generates and provision any TVM
it creates with its CDI. TVM CDIs are derived from the TSM CDI and the TVM
specific measurements. However, unlike the RoT and the TSM-driver, the TSM does
not pass attestation certificates to its TVMs. For evidence freshness
establishment reasons, TVMs asynchronously request their attestation certificates
from the TSM, in the form of a TSM-signed Attestation Evidence.

TVMs are the CoVE DICE chain leaves and they can obtain an Attestation Evidence
from the TSM by calling the CoVE guest-ABI `sbi_covg_get_evidence()` FID. The TVM
provides a challenge value to the TSM through this call, and that value must be
included in the generated Evidence. This value allows relying parties to establish
the Attestation Evidence freshness.

The CoVE Evidence is composed of separated but cryptographically bound
attestation tokens for each of the above-describe TCB layers (Platform, TSM and
TVM). As described above, each TCB layer uses its DICE-derived attestation key
to signs the next layer, creating a HW RoT-rooted signature chain.
A Relying Party can then verify and authenticate the Evidence with platform
owner or manufacturer provided Endorsements, like e.g. a Trust Anchor.

The TCB extension and evidence collection for a TVM attestation is shown
below:

[caption="Figure {counter:image}: ", reftext="Figure {image}"]
[title= "Layered Attestation architecture for TVMs"]
image::layered_attestation.svg[]

It is expected that an implementation will provide implementation-specific
intrinsics to record measurements of the TSM into the firmware RoT for
measurement to support the CoVE layered RTMs attestation of CoVE workloads.

==== Evidence Format

The CoVE Attestation Evidence uses the IETF Entity Attestation Token
(<<EAT>>), formatted as an untagged, unprotected Concise Binary Object
Representation (<<CBOR>>) Web Token (<<UCCS>>). A CoVE EAT profile is proposed
to narrow the EAT specification for the CoVE use case to enable interoperability.

The UCCS is composed of one EAT submodule Claims-Set map where the map values
are attestation tokens for the TVM, TSM and Platform Claims.

The TVM EAT is a CWT tagged CBOR formatted token, wrapped with a
COSE_Sign1 <<COSE>> envelope. It is signed by the TSM attestation key and must
contain a TVM provided challenge, e.g. a Relying Party provided nonce for
establishing Evidence freshness.

The TSM EAT is a CWT tagged CBOR formatted token, wrapped with a
COSE_Sign1 <<COSE>> envelope. It is signed by the Platform attestation key and
must include the DICE derived public key for the TSM.

The Platform EAT is a CWT tagged CBOR formatted token, wrapped with a
COSE_Sign1 <<COSE>> envelope. It is signed by the RoT attestation key and must
include the DICE derived public key for the Platform.

The CoVE layered Evidence structure is represented by the above described
composition of cryptographically chained EAT tokens. Verifier can then attest
of a CoVE workload trustworthiness by independenly inspecting each token,
while being able to verify that the TCB represented by one token was used to
generate the next one.

identity or more generically a specific piece of data (e.g. an Attestation
Service public key, a configuration blob, etc) through its hash value.

TVM identity allows for untrusted hosts to provide a TVM with unmeasured but
attestable pieces of data. A Relying Party can then verify the TVM measurements
separately from the host provided TVM identity.

generate the component measurement. It is recommended to use one of the IANA
registered hash algorithm name<<Hash_Algorithm_Names>>.

====== TVM Dynamic Measurements Claim

The TVM dynamic measurements claim value is the list of all dynamic measurements
for the TVM. The list must contain at most 8 entries.

By calling into the `sbi_covg_extend_measurement()` SBI FID, a TVM guest can
extend TVM measurements after the TVM is finalized. The extended measurement
values are stored into a set of dynamic measurement registers.

==== Evidence Generation

TVM guest Attesters can request from the TSM to generate an Evidence that attest
to their own layered TCB layers, by calling into the TG-ABI
`sbi_covg_get_evidence()` FID.

The `sbi_covg_get_evidence()` returns an attestation certificate that includes
the UCCS EAT formatted CoVE Attestation Evidence described in the previous
sections of this document.

The attestation key and certificate generation for the TVM may be performed
by the TSM directly or with a U-mode TSM component, to allow for the
interruptibility models discussed in the TSM operation section of this document.

The CoVE attestation certificate can either be X.509<<X509>> or CBOR
formatted, depending on the `format` argument passed by the Attester to
`sbi_covg_get_evidence()`. CoVE implementations must support at least one
certificate format, and describe all supported formats through the
`AttestationCapabilities` structure returned by the `sbi_covg_get_attcaps()`
SBI call.

The CoVE attestation certificate issuer is the TSM and is represented by the
TSM `CDI_ID` lowercase hexadecimal encoded string.

The CoVE attestation certificate subject is the TVM and is represented by the
TVM `CDI_ID` lowercase hexadecimal encoded string.

===== CBOR Attestation Certificate

CBOR formatted CoVE Attestation certificates are COSE_Sign1 protected CWTs,
signed with the TSM attestation key. The algorithm used to sign the certificate
is described by the COSE_Sign1 envelope. It is recommended to use an EdDSA
scheme with SHA-512, e.g. Ed25519.

The CBOR certificate COSE_Sign1 payload is a CWT which claim set is composed of
the CoVE evidence token and 2 additional claims:

* *Issuer* is the certificate issuer representation, i.e. the TSM `CDI_ID`.
* *Subject* is the certificate subject representation, i.e. the TVM `CDI_ID`.

===== X.509 Attestation Certificate

X.509 formatted CoVE Attestation certificates are leaf certificates that
follow the DICE<<DICE>> X.509 certificate extension format. They are signed by
the TSM attestation key and contain a DICE defined custom extension for carrying
the attestation evidence as an unprotected CWT Claim Set<<UCCS>>.

The X.509 custom extension value is generated by wrapping the CoVE attestation
evidence into a tagged UCCS.

The TSM generated certificate fields, standard and custom extensions, along with
the UCCS formatted evidence are described below:

[options=header]
|===
| *Field*              | *Description*
| signatureAlgorithm   | `id-ecdsa-with-SHA512`<<X509_DSA>> is recommended.
                         Other signature algorithms may be used.

| signatureValue       | 64 bytes ECDSA signature, using the TSM `CDI_PriKey` as
                         the signing key

| version              | v3
| serialNumber         | The TSM `CDI_ID` in ASN.1 INTEGER form
| signature            | `id-ecdsa-with-SHA512`<<X509_DSA>> is recommended.
                         Other signature algorithms may be used.

| issuer               | The TSM `CDI_ID`
| validity             | The validity values are populated as follows:
                         `notBefore` can be any time known to be in the past,
                         and `notAfter` is set to the standard value used to
                         indicate no well-known expiry date, “99991231235959Z”
                         per RFC 5280.

| subject              | The TVM `CDI_ID`
| subjectPublicKeyInfo | When using EcDSA, per RFC 5480 (id-ecPublicKey)
| issuerUniqueID       | Not used
| subjectUniqueID      | Not used
| extensions           | Standard extensions are included as well as a custom
                         TCG DICE extension which holds the CoVE attestation
                         evidence. Both are described below.
