| Hypervisor or Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM) | HS mode software 
that manages Virtual Machines by virtualizing hart, guest physical memory and 
IO resources. This document uses the term VMM and hypervisor interchangeably 
for this software entity.

| VM | Virtual Machines hosted by a VMM

| Host software | All software elements including type-1 or type-2 HS-mode VMM 
and OS; U mode user-space VMM tools; ordinary VMs hosted by the VMM that 
emulate devices. The hosting platform is typically a multi-tenant platform 
that hosts multiple mutually distrusting Tenants.

| Tenant software | All software elements including VS-mode guest kernel 
software, and guest user-space software (in VU-mode) that are deployed 
by the workload owner (in a multi-tenant hosting environment).

| Trusted Computing Base (TCB)Also, System/ Platform TCB | The hardware, 
software and firmware elements that are trusted by a relying party to 
protect the confidentiality and integrity of the relying parties' workload 
data and execution against a defined adversary model. In a system with 
separate processing elements within a package on a socket, the TCB 
boundary is the package. In a multi-socket system the TCB extends across 
the socket-to-socket interface, and is managed as one system TCB.

| Application Processor (AP) | APs can support commodity operating systems,
 hypervisors/VMMs and applications software workloads. The AP subsystem 
 may contain several processing units, on-chip caches, and other controllers 
for interfacing with memory, accelerators, and other fixed-function logic. 
Multiple APs may be used within a logical system.
 
| AP-TEE | Application Processor- Trusted Execution Environment: An execution 
mode that provides HW-isolation for workload assets when in use (user/ 
supervisor code/ data) and provides HW-attestable confidentiality and 
integrity protection against specific attack vectors per a specified 
adversary and threat model. The term TEE and hardware-based TEE are also 
used as synonyms of AP-TEE in this document.
 
| Confidential Computing | The protection of data in use by performing 
computation in a Hardware-based TEE.

| TVM | TEE or Confidential VM - A VM instantiation of an AP-TEE workload

| Confidential application or library | A user-mode application or 
library instantiation in a TVM. The user-mode application may be supported 
via a trusted runtime. The user-mode library may be hosted by a surrogate 
process runtime.

| Attestation | The process by which a relying party can assess the 
security posture of the AP-TEE workload based on verifying a set of 
HW-rooted cryptographically-protected evidence.
 
| TEE Security Manager (TSM) | HS-mode software module that acts as 
the trusted (in TCB) intermediary between the VMM and the TVM. This 
module extends the TCB chain on the AP-TEE platform.

| RoT | Isolated HW/SW subsystem with an immutable ROM firmware and 
isolated compute and memory elements that form the Trusted Compute Base 
of a TEE system. The RoT manages cryptographic keys and other security 
critical functions such as system lifecycle and debug authorization. 
The RoT provides trusted services to other software on the platform such 
as verified boot, key provisioning, and management, security lifecycle 
management, sealed storage, device management, crypto services, 
attestation etc. The RoT may be an integrated or discrete element <<R7>>, 
and may take on the role of a Device Identification Composition Engine 
(DICE) as defined in <<R2>>.

| TEE-capable memory | Memory that provides access-control, confidentiality 
and integrity suitable per the threat model for use in the AP-TEE system. 
TEE-capable memory may also be used by untrusted software with appropriate 
TCB controls on the configuration.

| SVN | Security Version Number - Meta-data about the TCB components 
that conveys the security posture of the TCB. The SVN is a monotonically 
increasing version number updated when security changes must be reflected in 
the attestation. The SVN is hence provided as part of the attestation 
information as part of the evidence of the TCB in use. The SVN is typically 
combined with other meta-data elements when evaluating the attestation 
information. 

| CDI | Compound Device Identifier - This value represents the hardware, 
software and firmware combination measured by the TCB elements transitively. 
A CDI is the output of a DICE <<R2>> and is passed to the entity which is 
measured by the previous TCB layer. The CDI is a secret that may be 
certified to use for attestation protocols. 

| AIA | Advanced Interrupt Architecture

| IMSIC | Incoming Message Signaled Interrupt Controller

| MMIO | Memory Mapped I/O
