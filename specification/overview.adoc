== Architecture Overview and Threat Model

Virtualization platforms are typically comprised of several components including
platform firmware, host OS, VMM, and the actual payloads that run on them (typically
in a VM). This model is well established, but the downside is that most platform
components are in the TCB. This aspect is ill-suited for Confidential Computing workloads
that rely on HW-Attested Trusted Execution Environments, and strive to minimize the 
TCB footprint.

This specification describes the AP-TEE architecture which describes a new class of 
hardware-attested trusted execution environment called TEE Virtual machines (TVM). 
The TVMs are supported by a hardware-rooted, attestable TCB and are run-time-isolated from 
the host OS/VMM and other platform software not in the TCB of the TVM. TVMs 
are protected from a broad set of software-based and hardware-based threats 
per the threat model described in <<4_1_adversary_model>>. The design enables 
the OS or VMM to maintain the role of resource manager even for the TVMs. The 
resources managed by the untrusted OS/VMM include memory, CPU, I/O resources 
and platform capabilities to execute the TVM workload.

As shown in figure 1, the architecture comprises a HS-mode software module 
called the " *TEE Security Manager* " *(TSM)* that acts as the trusted 
intermediary between TEE and non-TEE workloads. The TSM has a minimal possible 
HW-attested footprint. The TCB (which includes the TSM and HW) enforces strict 
confidentiality and integrity security properties for workloads. It also isolates 
confidential workloads from all other platform components (non-confidential and 
confidential). The responsibility of the TSM is to enforce the security objectives 
accorded to TEE workloads. The VMM continues to manage the security for 
non-confidential workloads, and the resource and scheduling management functions for 
all workloads (confidential and non-confidential).

In this scheme, compute resources like memory start off as 
traditional untrusted resources in the non-confidential world, and are transitioned 
to their confidential analogue via the TSM. Once the conversion process is complete, 
confidential memory may be assigned to a TVM via the TSM. A converted confidential 
resource can be freely assigned to another TVM when it's no longer in use. 
However, an unused confidential resource must be explicitly reclaimed for use in the 
non-confidential world (this is tracked and enforced by the TSM).

The TEE address space can be comprised of confidential and non-confidential regions. 
The former includes both measured pages (that are part of the initial TVM payload), 
and confidential zero-pages that can be mapped-in on demand by the VMM following runtime 
accesses by the TVM. The non-confidential TVM-defined regions include those for 
shared-pages and MMIO. 

The TSM implements a set of TEE "flows" that are accessed via a *Trusted Execution Environment Interface 
(TEEI)* ABI hosted by a Trusted Security Manager Driver ( *TSM Driver* ) 
component operating in the M-mode of the CPU. The TSM itself operates in 
HS-mode (priv=01; V=0) of the CPU and enables the OS/VMM (also in HS-mode) to 
create TVMs, assign resources to TVMs, manage/execute and destroy a TVM - 
_this specification aims to describe the TEEI and TSM interfaces_. By using 
the Hypervisor extension of the RISC-V privileged specification <<R0>>, this 
specification minimizes ISA changes to introduce a scalable architecture for 
hosting TEE workloads. More than one TVM may be hosted by the host OS/VMM. 
Each TVM may consist of the guest firmware, a guest OS and applications.

As shown in figure 1, the M-mode firmware is in the TCB of all AP-TEE 
workloads hosted on the platform. The TSM-driver (operating in M-mode) uses 
the hardware capabilities to provide:

* Isolation of memory associated with TEEs (including the TSM). We describe 
*TEE- capable memory* as memory that provides access-control, confidentiality 
and integrity suitable for use for AP-TEE components. The TEEI operations for 
memory management are described in detail below. 
* Context switching of the hart state on TEE/Non-TEE transitions.
* A machine agnostic ABI as part of the TEEI, to allow lower privileged 
software to interact with the TSM-driver in an OS and platform agnostic manner.

The TSM-driver delegates parts of the TEE management functions to the TSM, 
specifically isolation across TEE-capable memory assigned to TVMs. The TSM is 
designed to be portable across AP-TEE class platforms and interact with the 
machine specific capabilities in the platform through the TEEI. The TSM 
provides an ABI to the OS/VMM which has two aspects: A *TH-ABI* that includes 
functions to manage the lifecycle of the TVM, such as creating, adding pages 
to a TVM, scheduling a TVM for execution, etc. in an OS/platform agnostic 
manner. The TSM also provides an ABI to the TVM contexts: A *TG-ABI* to enable 
the TVM workload to request attestation functions, memory management  
functions or paravirtualized IO functions.

In order to isolate the TVMs from the host OS/VMM and non-confidential VMs, 
the TSM state must be isolated first - this is achieved by enforcing isolation 
for memory assigned to the TSM - this is called the *TSM-memory-region.* The 
TSM-memory-region is expected to be a static region of memory that holds the 
TSM code and data. This region must be access-controlled from all software 
outside the TCB, and may be additionally protected against physical access via 
cryptographic mechanisms. Access to the TSM- memory-region and execution of 
code from the TSM-memory-region (the TSM flows) is predicated in hardware via 
an *AP-TEE mode bit* maintained per hart. This mode is enabled per-hart via 
TEECALL and disabled via TEERET for operations described in the TEEI. Access 
to TEE-assigned memory is allowed for the hart when the AP-TEE mode is set. 
This per-hart AP-TEE mode bit is used by the processor to enforce 
access-control properties on instructions restricted for use by the TSM. This 
bit is cached in other micro-architectural states to enforce the isolation for 
TEE (TSM, TVM) resources (such as memory, IO, CSRs, TLB, paging structure 
caches etc). The implementation of this mode bit is not specified by this 
document, and may be implemented via an M-mode CSR for example.

The TSM functionality is explicitly limited to support the necessary security 
primitives to ensure that the OS/VMM and non-confidential VMs do not violate 
the security of the TVMs through the resource management actions of the 
OS/VMM. These security primitives require the TSM to enforce TVM virtual-hart 
state save and restore,  as well as enforcing invariants for memory assigned 
to the TVM (including stage 2 translation). The host OS/VMM provides the 
typical VM resource management functionality for memory, IO etc.  

Confidential VMs (under a VMM) are shown in figure 1 and Confidential 
applications (managed by an untrusted host OS) are shown in the 
architecture figure 2. As evident from the architecture, the difference 
between these two scenarios is the software TCB (owned by the tenant within 
the TVM) for the tenant workload - in the application TEE case, a minimal 
guest OS runtime may be used; whereas in the VM TEE case, an enlightened 
guest OS is in the TVM TCB. Other software models that map to the VU/VS 
modes of operation are also possible as TEE workloads. Importantly, the HW 
mechanisms needed for both cases are identical, and can be supported with 
appropriate extensions of the TG-ABI.

The detailed architecture is described in the Section 
<<5_reference_architecture_details>>. Note that the architecture described 
above may have various implementations, however the goal of this specification 
is to propose a reference architecture and ratify a normative TEEI as a RISC-V non-ISA 
specification.
