== Reference Architecture Details

We describe the capabilities of the platform to support memory isolation 
requirements for confidentiality of workloads in TVMs. We then describe 
the properties of the TSM, its instantiation, isolation and operational model 
for the TVM lifecycle. The description in this section refers to the reference 
architecture in Figure 1.

=== AP-TEE Memory Isolation

Memory isolation for TVMs are orchestrated by the TSM in two phases, 
the conversion of memory to Confidential memory and the assignment of 
confidential memory (and the enforcement of properties on its use) to TVMs. 
Thus, AP-TEE requires new Physical Memory Attributes (PMAs): *Confidential* 
and *Non-Confidential* (These are dynamic/programmable memory attributes 
[priv ISA]). A TVM needs to access both types of memory:

* Confidential memory - has Confidential PMA - used for TVM code, data
* Non-Confidential memory - has Non-Confidential PMA - used for communication between TVM and untrusted host entities

The TEEI implemented by the TSM provides interfaces to the VMM to convert / 
donate memory to Confidential [Convert] and vice-versa [Reclaim]. 
TVM memory is by default assigned from Confidential memory regions. 
TVM may be assigned shared memory regions. Both properties are enforced 
by the TSM. Figure 3 below shows the abstract model of isolation:

* Hart with AP-TEE mode qualifier =1 is allowed to access Confidential 
and Non-Confidential memory
* Hart with AP-TEE mode qualifier =0 is allowed to access only Non-confidential Memory

Figure 3: Confidential Memory conversion

Memory with Confidential PMA may be associated with a unique memory encryption 
key (and similar IO/fabric protection policies). 
Non-confidential memory is assigned by the VMM - the TSM and TSM-driver are 
expected to manage the Confidentiality PMA by programming a Memory Tracking Table (MTT). 
The desired security properties of memory tracking are discussed below - implementations 
are free to choose the format and structure of the memory tracking table/structures. 
The TSM manages finer-granular (page-based) allocation from Confidential memory regions 
(enforced by the memory tracking hardware) using the G stage page tables.

Four aspects of memory isolation are impacted due this dynamic configurable confidential PMA: 

==== Address Translation/Page Walk
The figure 4 below describes a reference model for memory tracking lookup where 
the physical address derived from the first and guest stage nested page walk is 
looked up to derive a confidential | non-confidential physical memory attribute. 
This lookup should be performed for the page sizes per the paging modes supported by the hart.

Figure 4: Memory Tracking for Confidential PMA
	
==== Management of Confidential | Non-Confidential dynamic Physical Memory Attributes

The SW TCB manages the assignment of the confidential PMA to memory regions, 
while the HW TCB enforces the confidential PMA for TVM accesses. The region sizes 
at which the memory tracking enforces confidential properties may be multiples of 
the architectural page sizes supported by the hart MMU. Similarly, the IOMMU should 
support a similar memory tracking lookup to enable direct device access into TVM memory 
regions. For the AP-TEE reference architecture this TCB hence consists of the HW 
(MMU, IOMMU, Memory Controller) and the SW/FW elements - TSM-driver and the TSM. 
The TSM is responsible for enforcing isolation of confidential memory pages among TVMs 
(via G-stage translation) - pages assigned to the TVM may belong to C | NC PMA to 
allow for IO access. The TSM may manage additional attributes on TVM-assigned pages such as: 
TVM-owner, Page-sub-type, TLB versioning information, Locking semaphore and additional metadata etc.
This extended memory tracking information managed by the TSM is refered to as the EMTT.

==== Handling Implicit, Explicit Accesses
For TVM accesses for instruction fetch and page walks (virtual address 
translation), a Confidential PMA is required to enforce the following security properties:

* TEE Instruction fetch - security property: TVM/TSM cannot fetch code 
from untrusted shared memory
* TEE Paging structure walk - security property: TVM/TSM cannot locate 
page tables in untrusted shared memory (for TVM, G-stage walks enforced 
to be in confidential memory by the TSM)
* TEE data fetch - security property: TVM/TSM allowed to relax data 
accesses to non-confidential memory (via MTT) to allow for IO accesses.

==== Cached translations/TLB management
During confidential memory conversion or reclamation, the TCB must 
enforce that stale translations cached in harts are not accessible 
to the untrusted host or another TVM context.
During confidential memory assignment to a TVM (or during conversion 
of confidential memory to shared), the TCB must enforce that stale 
translations may not be held to memory yielded by a TVM (and used 
by the host for another TVM or VM or the host). 
These properties are implemented by the TSM in conjunction with 
the HW TCB via the proposed TEEI.

=== TSM initialization

The AP-TEE architecture requires a hardware Root-of-trust for supporting 
TCB measurement, reporting and storage <<R8>>. The Root-of-trust for 
Measurement (RTM) is defined as the TCB component that performs a 
measurement of an entity and protects it for subsequent reporting. The 
Root-of-trust for Reporting (RTR) is typically a HW RoT that reliably 
provides authenticity and non-repudiation services for the purposes of 
attesting to the origin, integrity and security version of platform TCB 
components. Each TCB layer should have associated security version numbers 
(SVN) to allow for TCB recovery in the event of security vulnerabilities 
discovered in a prior version of the TCB layer.

During platform initialization, HW elements form the RTM that measure the 
TSM-driver. The TSM-driver acts as the RTM for the TSM loaded on the 
platform. The TSM-driver initializes the TSM-memory-region for the TSM - 
this TSM-memory-region must be in TEE-capable memory. The TSM binary may be 
provided by the OS/VMM which may independently authenticate the binary 
before loading the binary into the TSM-memory-region via the TSM-driver. 
Alternatively, the firmware may pre-load the TSM binary via the TSM-driver. 
In both cases, the TSM binary loaded must be measured and may be 
authenticated (per cryptographic signature mechanisms) by the TSM-driver 
during the loading process, so that the TSM used is reflected in the 
attestation rooted in a HW RoT. The authentication process provides 
additional control to restrict TSM binaries that can be loaded on the 
platform based on policies such as version, vendor etc.  In addition to the 
measurements, a security version number (SVN) of the TSM should be recorded 
by the TSM-driver into the firmware measurement registers accessible only 
to the TSM-driver and higher privilege components. The measurements and 
versions of the HW RoT, the TSM-driver and the TSM will subsequently be 
provided as evidence of a specific TSM being loaded on a specific platform. 

During initialization, the TSM-driver will initialize a TSM-data region 
within the TSM-memory region. The TSM-data region may hold per-hart TSM 
state, memory assignment tracking structures and additional global data for 
TSM management. The TSM-data region is TEE-capable memory that is apriori 
access-control-restricted by the TSM-driver to allow only the TSM to access 
this memory. The per-hart TSM state is used to start TSM execution from a 
known-good state for security routines invoked by the OS/VMM. The per-hart 
TSM state should be stored in pages that form a TSM Hart Control Structure 
(THCS - See Appendix A) which is initialized as part of the TSM memory 
initialization. The THCS structure definition is part of the TEEI and may 
be extended by an implementation, with the minimum state shown in the 
structure. Isolating and establishing the execution state of the TSM is the 
responsibility of the TSM-driver. Saving and restoring  of the execution 
state of the TSM (for interrupted routines) is performed by the TSM. The 
operating modes of the TSM are described in Section 5.2. Saving and 
restoring of the TVM execution state in the TVM virtual-harts (called the 
VHCS) is the responsibility of the TSM and is held in TEE-capable memory 
assigned to the TVM by the VMM.

=== TSM operation and properties

The TSM implements security routines that are invoked by the OS/VMM or by 
the TVMs, e.g. by the VMM to grant a TVM a TEE-capable memory page and 
setup second-stage mapping, activate a TVM virtual hart on a physical hart 
etc. The TSM security routines are invoked by the OS/VMM via an ECALL with 
the service call specified via registers.  These service calls trap to the 
TSM-driver.  The TSM-driver switches hart state to the TSM context by 
loading the hart's TSM execution state from the THCS.tssa and then returns 
via an MRET to the TSM. The TSM executes the security routine requested 
(where the TSM enforces the security properties) and may either return to 
the OS/VMM via an ECALL to the TSM-driver (TEERET with reason), or may use 
an SRET to return/enter into a TVM. On a subsequent TVM synchronous or 
asynchronous trap (due to ECALLs or any exception/interrupt) from a TVM, 
the TSM handles the cases delegated to it by the TSM-driver (via mideleg). 
The TSM saves the TVM state and invokes the TSM-driver via an ECALL (TEERET 
with reason) to initiate the return of execution control to the OS/VMM if 
required. The TSM-driver restores the context for the OS/VMM via the 
per-hart control sub-structure THCS.hssa (See Appendix A). This canonical 
flow is shown in figure 3.

Beyond the basic operation described above, the following different 
operational models of the TSM may be supported by an implementation:

* *Uninterruptible* *TSM* - In this model, the TSM security routines are 
executed in an uninterruptible manner for S-mode interrupts (M-mode 
interrupts are not inhibited). This implies that the TSM execution always 
starts from a fixed initial state of the TSM harts and completes the 
execution with either a TEERET to return control to the OS/VMM or via an 
SRET to enter into a TVM (where the execution may be interruptible again).

* *Interruptible TSM with no re-entrancy* - In this model, after the 
initial entry to the TSM with S-mode interrupts disabled, the TSM enables 
interrupts during execution of  the TSM security routines. The TSM may 
install its interrupt handlers at this entry (or may be installed via the 
TEECALL flow as shown below). On an S-mode interrupt, the TSM hart context 
is saved by the TSM and keeps the interrupt pending. The TSM may then 
TEERET to the host OS/VMM with explicit information about the interruption 
provided via the pending interrupt to the OS/VMM. The TSM-driver supports a 
TEERESUME ECALL which enables the TSM to enforce that the resumption of the 
interrupted TSM security routine is initiated by the OS/VMM on the same 
hart. The TSM hart context restore is enforced by the TSM to allow for the 
resumed TSM security routine operation to complete. An example of an 
interruptible flow is the conversion of a large 2MB page to confidential 
memory, which may require a long latency encryption operation. Intermediate 
state of the operation must be saved and restored by the TSM for such 
flows. 

**__This specification describes the operation of the TSM in this 
mode of operation.__**

* *Interruptible and re-entrant TSM* - In this model, similar to the 
previous case, the TSM security routines are executed in an interruptible 
manner, but are also allowed to be re-entrant. This requires support for 
trusted thread contexts managed by the TSM. A TSM security routine invoked 
by the OS/VMM is executed in the context of a specific TSM thread context 
(a stack structure may also be used). On an interruption of that routine 
using a TSM thread context, the TSM saves the TSM execution context for the 
TSM thread and returns control to the OS/VMM via a TEERET. The OS/VMM can 
handle the interrupt and may resume that TSM thread or may invoke another 
TSM security routine on a different (non-busy) thread context (and on a 
different hart). This model of TSM operation requires additional 
concurrency controls on internal data structures and per-TVM global data 
structures (such as the second stage page table structures).

image:img_3.png[]  
Figure 3: TSM operation - Interruptible and non-reentrant TSM model shown.

A TSM entry triggered by an ECALL (with AP-TEE service type) by the OS/VMM 
leads to the following context-switch to the TSM (performed by the 
TSM-driver):

The initial state of the TSM will be to start with a fixed reset value for 
the registers that are restored on resumed security operations.

*ECALL (* *TEECALL* */ TEERESUME* *)* *pseudocode - implemented by the 
TSM-driver*

* If trap is due to synchronous trap due to TEECALL/ TEERESUME then enable 
AP-TEE mode = 1 for the hart via M-mode CSR (implementation-specific)
* Locate the per-hart THCS (located within TSM-driver memory data region)
* Save operating VMM csr context into the THCS.hssa (Hart Supervisor State 
Area) fields : sstatus, stvec, scounteren, sscratch, satp (and other x 
state other than a0, a1 - see <<9_appendix_a_thcs_and_vhcs>>). Note that 
any v/f register state must be saved by the caller.
* Save THCS.hssa.pc as mepc+4 to ensure that a subsequent resumption 
happens from the pc past the TEECALL
* Establish the TSM operating context from the THCS.tssa (TSM Supervisor 
State Area) fields (See Appendix A)
* Set scause to indicate TEECALL
* Disable interrupts via sie=0. 
  ** For a preemptable TSM, interrupts do not stay disabled - the TSM may 
enable interrupts and so S/M-mode interrupts may occur while executing in 
the TSM. S-mode interrupts will cause the TSM to save state and TEERET.
* MRET to resume execution in TSM at THCS.tssa.stvec

*ECALL (synchronous explicit TEERET) OR Asynchronous M-mode trap pseudocode 
- implemented by TSM-driver*

* Locate the per-hart THCS (located within TSM-driver memory data region)
* If Asynchronous M-mode trap: 
  ** Handle M-mode trap
  ** If required, pend an S-mode interrupt to the TSM and SRET
* _Implementation Note -_ _The TSM-driver does not need to keep state of 
the TSM being interrupted as, on an interrupt the TSM can enforce:_
  ** _If it was preemptible but not-reentrant that the next invocation on 
that hart is a TEERESUME with identical parameters as the interrupted 
security routine._
  ** _If the TSM was preemptible and re-entrant then the TSM would accept 
both TEERESUME and TEECALL as subsequent invocations (as long as TSM 
threads are available)._
* Restore the OS/VMM state saved on transition to the TSM: sstatus, stvec, 
scounteren, sscratch, satp and x registers (other than a0, a1). Note that 
any v/f register state must be restored by the caller.
* TSM-driver passes TSM/TVM-specified register contents to the OS/VMM to 
return status from TEERET (TSM sets a0, a1 registers always - other 
registers may be selected by the TVM)
* Clear AP-TEE-mode on hart (via implementation-specific M-mode CSR to 
block non-TEE mode accesses to TEE-assigned memory.) 
* MRET to resumes execution in OS/VMM at mepc set to THCS.hssa.pc 
(THCS.hssa.pc adjusted to refer to opcode after the ECALL that triggered 
the TEECALL / TEERESUME) 

The TSM is stateless across TEECALL invocations, however a security routine 
invoked in the TSM via a TEECALL may be interrupted and must be resumed via 
a TEERESUME i.e. _the TSM is preemptable but non-reentrant_ . These 
properties are enforced by the TSM-driver, and other models described above 
may be implemented. The TSM does not perform any dynamic resource 
management, scheduling, or interrupt handling of its own. The TSM is not expected 
to issue IPIs itself; the TSM must track if appropriate IPIs are issued by the 
host OS/VMM to track that the required security checks are performed on each 
physical hart (or virtual hart context) as required by specific TEEI flows.

When the TSM is entered via the TSM-driver (as part of the ECALL [TEECALL] 
- MRET), the TSM starts with sstatus.sie set to 0 i.e. interrupts disabled. 
The sstatus.sie does not affect HS interrupts from being seen when mode = 
U/VS/VU. The OS/VMM sip and sie will be saved by the TSM in the HSSA and 
will retain the state as it existed when the host OS/VMM invoked the TSM. 
The TSM may establish the execution context and re-enable interrupts 
(sstatus.sie set to 1). 

If an M-mode interrupt occurs while the hart is operating in the TSM or any 
TVM, the control always goes to the TSM-driver handler, which can handle 
it, or if the event must be reported to the untrusted OS/VMM, they are 
pended as S-mode interrupts to the TSM which must save its execution 
context and return control to the OS/VMM via a TEERET..

If an S-mode interrupt occurs while the hart is operating in the TSM 
(HS-mode), it should pre-empt out and return to the OS/VMM using TEERET. 
The TSM may take certain actions on S-mode interrupts - for example, saving 
status of a host security routine, and/or change the status of TVMs. The 
TSM is however not expected to retire the S-mode interrupt but keep the 
event pending so they are taken when control returns to the OS/VMM via the 
TEERET.

If a S-mode interrupt occurs in U, VU or VS - external, timer, or software 
- then that causes the trap handler in TSM to be invoked. In response to 
trap delivery, the TSM saves the TVM virtual-hart state and returns to the 
OS/VMM via a TEERET ECALL. As part of return to the OS/VMM, the sstatus of 
OS/VMM is restored and when the OS starts executing the pending interrupt - 
external, timer, or software - may or may not be taken depending on the OS 
sstatus.sie. Under these circumstances the saving of the TVM state is the 
TSM responsibility. 

When TVM is executing, hideleg will only delegate VS-mode external 
interrupt, VS-mode SW interrupt, and VS-mode timer interrupts to the TVM. 
S-mode SW/Timer/External interrupts are delegated to the TSM (with the 
behavior described above). _All other interrupts_ , M-mode 
SW/Timer/External, bus error, high temp, RAS etc. are not delegated and 
delivered to M-mode/TSM-driver. Under these circumstances the saving of the 
state is the TSM-driver responsibility. Also since scrubbing the TVM state 
is the TSM responsibility, the TSM-driver may pend an S-mode interrupt to 
the TSM to allow cleanup on such events. See Appendix B for a table of 
interrupt causes and handling requirements.

The TSM may not need to program stimecmp on its own, though it may verify 
that time is not going back for a TVM. If the TSM needs to start a timer, 
it should context switch the stimecmp CSR and replace it with its timeout 
value if it's later than the timer it wants to start. The TSM may still 
want to be aware of the value programmed into stimecmp to guard against 
step attacks on TVMs.

Any NMIs experienced during TSM/TVM execution are always handled by the 
TSM-driver and must cause the TEEs to be destroyed (preventing any loss of 
confidential info via clearing of machine state). The TSM and therefore all 
TVMs are prevented from execution after that point.

=== TSM and TVM Isolation

TSM (and all TVMs) memory is granted by the host OS/VMM but is isolated 
(via access-control and/or confidentiality-protection)  by the HW and TCB 
elements. The TSM, TVM and HW isolation methods used must be evident in the 
attestation evidence provided for the TVM since it identifies the hardware 
and the TSM-driver.

There are two facets of TVM and TSM memory isolation that are 
implementation-specific:

*a)* *Isolation from host software access* -  The CPU may enforce a 
hardware-based access-control of TSM memory to prevent access from host 
software (VMM and host OS) V=0, HS-mode untrusted code. TEE and TVM address 
spaces are identified by an additional (implementation-defined) *AP-TEE 
mode qualifier* to maintain the isolation during access and in internal 
caches, e.g. Hart TLB lookup may be extended with the AP-TEE mode 
qualifier. TVM memory isolation must support sparse memory management 
models and architectural page-sizes of 4KB, 64K, 2MB, 1GB (and optionally 
512GB). For example, The hardware may provide a memory ownership tracking 
table where there is an entry per physical page. The memory ownership 
tracking table may be a radix tree or a flat table. The memory ownership 
tracking table may allow memory ownership at multiple granularities such as 
4K, 64K, 2M, 1G, etc. The memory ownership table may be enforced at the 
memory controller, or in a page table walker.

*b)* *Isolation against physical/out-of-band access* - The platform TCB may 
provide confidentiality, integrity and replay-protection. This may be 
achieved via a Memory Encryption Engine (MEE) to prevent TEE state being 
exposed in volatile memory during execution. The use of an MEE and the 
number of encryption domains supported is implementation-specific. For 
example, The hardware may use the *AP-TEE mode qualifier* during execution 
(and memory access) to cryptographically isolate memory associated with a 
TEE which may be encrypted and additionally cryptographically 
integrity-protected using a MAC on the memory contents. The MAC may be 
maintained at various granularity - e.g. cache block size or in multiples 
of cache blocks.

*TVM isolation* is the responsibility of the TSM via the second stage 
address translation table (hgatp). The TSM must track memory assignment of 
TVMs (by the untrusted VMM/OS) to ensure memory assignment is 
non-overlapping, along with additional security requirements. The security 
requirements/invariants for enforcement of the memory 
access-control for memory assigned to the TVMs is described in <<TVM Memory management>>. 

=== TVM Execution

TVMs can access two classes of memory - "confidential memory" - which has 
confidentiality and access-control properties for memory exclusive to the 
TVM, and "non-confidential memory" which is memory accessible to the host 
OS/VMM and is used for untrusted operations (e.g. virt-io, grpc 
communication with/via the host). If the confidential memory is 
access-controlled only, the TSM and TSM-driver are the authority over the 
access-control enforcement. If the confidential memory is using memory 
encryption, the encryption keys used for confidential memory must be 
different from non-confidential memory. 

All TVM memory is mapped in the second-stage page tables controlled by the 
TSM explicitly - the allocation of memory for the second stage paging 
structures pages used for the second stage mapping is also performed by the 
OS/VMM but the security properties of the second stage mapping are enforced 
by the TSM. By default any memory mapped to a TVM is confidential. A TVM 
may then explicitly request that confidential memory be converted to 
non-confidential memory regions using services provided by the TSM. More 
information about TVM Execution and the lifecycle of a TVM is described in 
the <<TVM Lifecycle>> section of this document.

=== Debug and Performance Monitoring

The following additional considerations are noted for debug and performance 
monitoring:

*Debug mode considerations*

In order to support probe-mode debugging of the TSM, the RoT must support 
an authorized debug of the platform. The authentication mechanism used for 
debug authorization is implementation-specific, but must support the 
security properties described in the Section 3.12 of the RISC-V Debug 
Support specification version 1.0.0-STABLE <<R6>>. The RoT may support 
multiple levels of debug authorization depending on access granted. For 
probe-based debugging of the hardware, the RoT  performing debug 
authentication must ensure that separate attestation keys are used for TCB 
reporting when probe-debug is authorized vs when the platform is not under 
probe-debug mode.The probe-mode debug authorization process must invalidate 
sealed keys to disallow sealed data access when in probe-debug modes. 

When a TVM is under self-hosted debugging - on a transition to TVM 
execution, the TSM-driver must set up the trigger CSRs for the TVM. For TVM 
debugging, the TSM-driver may inhibit M and S/HS modes in the triggers. On 
transitions back to the OS/VMM, the TSM-driver will save the trigger CSRs 
and associated debug states, thus not leaking any information to non-TEE 
workloads. TVM self-hosted debug may be enabled from TVM creation time or 
may be explicitly opted-into during execution of the TVM. The TSM may 
invoke the TSM-driver to set up a TVM-specific trigger CSR state (per the 
configuration of the TVM).

*Performance Monitoring considerations*

By default the TSM and all TVMs run with performance monitoring suppressed. 
If a TVM runs in this default mode (opted out of performance monitoring), 
on a transition to the TVM, the TSM-driver enforces this via inhibiting the 
counters (using mcountinhibit). 

If the TVM has opted-in to performance monitoring, the TSM must invoke the 
TSM-driver to establish a TVM-specific performance monitoring controls 
(counters, event selectors). For any counters that the TVM will use, the 
TSM will assign those to the TVM via the TSM-driver and inhibit counting in 
HS/M mode. The TSM is free to use any 
counters that are not delegated. If the TSM is not using any counters and 
any of the TVMs opt-in to use hpm then the TSM may delegate the LCOFI 
interrupt (via hideleg[13]=1) for that TVM. The delegated TVM counters 
naturally inhibit counting in S/HS and M. The TSM-driver must save and 
clear counter/event selector values as control transitions to the VMM or a 
different TVM that is using hpm. On a transition back to the host OS/VMM, 
the TSM-driver must restore the saved hardware performance monitoring event 
triggers and counter enables. 

The TVM may opt-in to use performance monitoring either at initialization 
or post-init. For TVMs that have performance monitoring enabled, the 
TSM-driver may implement a service for the TSM to allow dynamically saving 
and restoring performance monitoring controls when a TVM is executing - 
this can reduce the performance overhead for the TSM-driver to only perform 
the save/restore of the controls when required by the TVM.
